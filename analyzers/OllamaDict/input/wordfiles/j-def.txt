The word "jaculate" is not a recognized part of speech in English or any other major human language.

To answer your question fully: The word "jaculation" is of unknown part of speech as it can function as both a noun and a verb. As a noun, it refers to a sudden ejection or emission. As a verb, it means to throw or eject suddenly. However, I cannot provide the infinitive form or conjugations for this word in its capacity as a verb because it is not a common English word and does not follow standard English conjugation rules. Additionally, there is no singular or plural form provided for "jaculation" as a noun since it is already in its base form.

'jagg' ==================================

  {
"word": "jagg",
"partOfSpeech": "Unknown",
"language": "Scottish Gaelic",
"rarity": "Rare",
"topicArea": "Unknown"
}

To provide a definition or conjugation for the word "jagg," more context is needed as it appears to be a Scottish Gaelic term with multiple meanings depending on the context. Some possible definitions include:

1. A sharp, pointed projection or tooth
2. To hunt game birds by flushing them out with dogs
3. To argue or quarrel noisily and persistently

If "jagg" is used as a verb in the sense of hunting game birds, then its infinitive form would be "to jagg." There are no known conjugations for this meaning as it is typically used in the past tense or participle form when describing the activity.

If "jagg" is used as a noun to refer to a sharp projection or tooth, then its singular form would be "jagg" and there is no known plural form.

Without further context, it is impossible to determine if "jagg" is a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, or interjection.

'jiggler' ==================================

  {
"word": "jiggler",
"partOfSpeech": "unknown",
"language": "English",
"commonality": "rare",
"topicArea": "Unknown"
}

To provide a definition or conjugation for the word "jiggler," more context is needed as it can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, in slang, it can refer to someone who jiggles or shakes something, while in other contexts, it may not be a recognized word at all.

If we assume that the intended meaning is related to the act of jiggling or shaking something, then "jiggler" would be a verb. In this case, the infinitive form would be "to joggle" or "to jiggle." The conjugations for the verb "jiggle" in the present tense are:

- I jiggle
- You (singular) jiggle
- He/She/It jiggles
- We jiggle
- They jiggle

In the past tense, the conjugations would be:

- I jiggled
- You (singular) jiggled
- He/She/It jiggled
- We jiggled
- They jiggled

If "jiggler" is intended to refer to a person who jiggles or shakes something, then it would be a noun in this context. In this case, the singular form would be "jiggler," and the plural form would be "jiggers." However, without more context, it's difficult to determine with certainty whether this is the intended meaning of the word.

  {
"word": "joyfuller",
"part_of_speech": "adjective",
"language": "English",
"rarity": "rare",
"topic_area": ["emotion", "mood"]
}

Please note that the word "joyfuller" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a comparative form of the adjective "joyful," but it does not have a widely accepted meaning or usage in English language. Therefore, it is considered rare and may not be found in common dictionaries or grammars.

If you meant to ask about the comparative form of the adjective "joyful" (i.e., "more joyful"), here's the correct information:

{
"word": "joyful",
"part_of_speech": "adjective",
"language": "English",
"rarity": "common",
"topic_area": ["emotion", "mood"],

"language": "English",
"rarity": "Rare",
"topic_area": "Emotion",
"definition": {
"singular": "",
"plural": ""
}
}

I'm sorry, but the word "joyfulnesses" is not a valid English word. It seems like you meant to ask about the word "joyfulness" instead. Here's the information for that:

{
"word": "joyfulness",
"part_of_speech": "Noun",
"language": "English",
"rarity": "Common",
"topic_area": "Emotion",
"definition": {
"singular": "The quality or state of being joyful; happiness and contentment.",

There is no infinitive form, conjugations, or other forms for the word "joyfulness" as it is a noun.

'joyhop' ==================================

  {
"word": "joyhop",
"partOfSpeech": "Unknown",
"language": "English (or possibly a neologism)",
"commonality": "Rare",

To provide a definition or conjugation for the word "joyhop," more context is needed. It's unclear whether it's a word in English or a neologism, and without additional information, it's impossible to determine its part of speech, singular/plural form (if applicable), infinitive form, or conjugations. If you could provide more context or clarify the meaning of "joyhop," I would be happy to help further.

{"person": "second", "tense": "past_continuous", "form": "had been enjoying"},
{"person": "third", "tense": "past_continuous", "form": "had been enjoying"}
]
}

Note: The word "joying" is actually a present participle form of the verb "enjoy". It can be used as an adjective to describe someone or something that is currently experiencing joy. However, in your question you asked for a definition of the word "joying" itself, so I provided the definition and conjugations as if it were a verb.

A jury-fixer is an individual who illegally influences the selection or decision of a jury in a trial.

"word": "jury-rigging",

"Jury-rigging" refers to the manipulation or falsification of a jury, often through illegal means, in order to influence its decision. It is an unethical practice and goes against the principles of fairness and impartiality in the legal system. The singular form is "jury-rigging" and there is no plural form as it is already a collective noun referring to the act itself.
