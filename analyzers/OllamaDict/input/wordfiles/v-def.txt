"vei" ==================================

  {
"word": "vei",
"language": "Norwegian",
"part_of_speech": "verb",
"definition": "to go or drive",

{"tense": "present continuous", "person": "2nd plural", "form": "går for à gå"},
{"tense": "present continuous", "person": "3rd plural", "form": "går for à gå"}
]
}

Note: The form "går for à gå" is the Norwegian present continuous or progressive tense, which can be translated to English as "is going to go". It's important to note that this tense construction is different from the simple future tense, which in Norwegian is formed with the auxiliary verb "vil" and the infinitive.

"veigle" ==================================

  {
"word": "veigle",
"part_of_speech": "Unknown",
"language": "Norwegian",
"frequency": "Rare",
"topic_area": "Unknown"
}

To provide a definition or conjugation for the word "veigle", more context is needed as it is an unfamiliar Norwegian word to me. It could be any part of speech, and without additional information, I cannot determine its infinitive form, singular and plural forms (if it's a noun), or its conjugations (if it's a verb).

"veil" ==================================

"veil-hid" ==================================

  {
"word": "veil-hid",
"part_of_speech": "unknown",
"language": "English (or possibly other English-derived languages) ",
"commonality": "rare",
"topic_area": "none"
}

To provide a definition or analysis for the word "veil-hid," more context is needed. The string of words appears to be a compound, with "veil" being a known noun and "hid" possibly being a past tense verb. However, without additional information, it's impossible to determine if "veil-hid" functions as a single word in English or if it should be analyzed as two separate words.

If "veil-hid" is indeed a compound word, its meaning could potentially relate to concealing or hiding something behind a veil. However, without further context, this definition remains speculative.

Here's some additional information on the given parts of speech:

* Noun: A noun is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. The singular form of "veil" is a noun. The plural form would be "veils."
* Verb: A verb is a word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. The infinitive form of "hid" is "to hide," and its conjugations include: I hid, you hid, he/she/it hid, we hid, they hid.
* Adjective: An adjective is a word that modifies or describes a noun or pronoun.
* Adverb: An adverb is a word that modifies or describes a verb, adjective, or other adverbs.
* Pronoun: A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun in a sentence.
* Preposition: A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence.
* Conjunction: A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence.
* Interjection: An interjection is a word or phrase that expresses strong emotion or excitement.

Without further context, it's impossible to determine if "veil-hid" functions as any of these parts of speech.

"word": "veiners",

Without additional context, it is impossible to determine if "veiners" is a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, or interjection. The term does not appear in standard English language dictionaries, suggesting that it is a rare word. In anatomy, veins are the vessels that carry blood towards the heart, so "veiners" could potentially refer to the thin walls of veins, but this is speculation without further context. If "veiners" is indeed a noun, its singular and plural forms would depend on the specific meaning intended by the speaker or writer. Similarly, if it is a verb, its infinitive form and conjugations would need to be determined based on an understanding of its meaning and function in a sentence.

To provide a definition or conjugation for the word "vendis," more context is needed as it is a Latin word with multiple meanings. Some possible definitions include:

2. A marketplace, market

3. ille/ea/id vendit (he/she/it sells)
4. nos vendimus (we sell)

To provide a definition and determine the part of speech for the word "vertugal," more context is needed.

  {
"word": "vindemiate",
"part_of_speech": "unknown",
"language_origin": "Italian",
"frequency": "rare",
"topic_area": ["wine", "harvest"]

{
"definition": "The act of gathering grapes from a vineyard for winemaking."
}

If "vindemiate" is indeed a verb in Italian, its infinitive form would be "vendemiar," and the conjugations might look like this (for the present tense):

{
"infinitive": "vendemiar",
"present_singular": {
  "1st_person": "vendo",
  "2nd_person": "vedi",
  "3rd_person_masculine": "vende",

"word": "viti-",
"part_of_speech": "prefix",

This prefix does not have infinitive form or conjugations as it is a part of speech that modifies other words. In Latin language, it means "to destroy, damage, or render invalid". It is often used in legal contexts to denote the act of vitiating or impairing something's validity. For example, in the phrase "vitiated witness", the prefix "vitiated" modifies the noun "witness" and implies that the witness's testimony has been rendered invalid or unreliable.

However, it does not have a clear meaning or usage in the context of English grammar or syntax. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, or interjection.
