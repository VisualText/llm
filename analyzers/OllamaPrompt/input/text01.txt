As for the noun "run," it refers to a continuous movement or course without any specific direction. Here are its singular and plural forms:

Singular: run
Plural: runs (not typically used in everyday English)

The noun "run" can also be used in other contexts like a series of similar things, as in "a run of good luck" or "the run of the mill," which would have different plural forms.

'jump' ==================================

  The word "jump" is primarily a verb in English. As a verb, it is used to describe an action where something moves from one place or level to another without staying there momentarily.

Here are all the simple present tense conjugations of "jump": I jump, you jump, he/she/it jumps, we jump, they jump.

If used as a noun, "jump" typically refers to a movement or act of jumping. However, it is less common for "jump" to function as a noun. In such cases, the singular and plural forms remain the same: Jump (singular) and Jumps (plural).

For example:
- Verb: John jumps over the fence.
- Noun: Take a look at these high jumps in the Olympics.

"Jump" is not an adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, or interjection in the English language.

'been' ==================================

  The word "been" functions as a verb in English grammar. It is the past-participle form of the verb "to be". Here are its conjugations:

1. I have been
2. You have been
3. He/She/It has been
4. We have been
5. They have been
6. Has been (used in questions and negative sentences)
7. Were + present participle (for past tense in the past simple, plural) - "Were you been?" or "We were been" (but this form is not commonly used in modern English)

As a noun, "been" does not have singular and plural forms because it is not a countable noun. It can function as an adjective in some phrases like "I have been there", but it does not have distinct singular and plural forms when used this way.

'are' ==================================

  The word "are" is a verb in the present tense, third person plural form. It is used to show that more than one subject is acting or is in a state.

In English, verbs typically have three main tenses: present, past, and future. However, the third-person plural present form of regular verbs doesn't change in most cases. So, for "are", there is no need to provide conjugations since it only has this one form.

As a noun, "are" is not a common usage. However, in some specific contexts, it can be used as a collective noun referring to a group or assembly of something. But in general English conversation and writing, the word "are" functions primarily as a verb.

In singular form, "are" cannot act as a noun, but if we use it as a noun in a context where it could be considered plural, then possible singular equivalents would be "is" or "an are" (in certain technical or poetic uses). For example, "An Are of Justice" or "The Is of Life." But these usages are not common.
