# Using Local Ollama to Build Dictionary

The idea behind this analyzer is to use a local LLM to generate responses to prompts asking about linguistic information about words in English.

## Installing Ollama

Currently, the python script in this analzyzer is only working for Linux systems. It was developed using WSL on a windows machine.

Install the python package using pip:

```
pip install ollama
```
